👋 Hi there, I'm Manish Thilagar 🤓

I love learning about how our brains process information, make decisions, and react to different stimuli. It's fascinating to see how data and insights from these technologies can be used to improve our understanding of the human mind and behavior! 😲


💻 SKILLS: Python (NumPy, Pandas, MNE-Python, Scikit-learn & Flask), Uipath & MySQL

🧠 Keen interested in cognitive science, which includes cool things like EEG, GSR, and eye tracker technologies

🌱 Always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in my field
